🏀 Athlete Fitness & VO2 Max Evaluation Tool
📘 Background

The Australian Men’s Basketball National Team is preparing for the 2024 Paris Olympics, and coaches are assessing player fitness as they enter training camp. This project uses key performance metrics to help analyse and compare the athletes’ physical condition.

📊 Fitness Metrics Used
1. BMI (Body Mass Index)

Calculated using each athlete’s pre-measured height and weight.

2. VO2 Max (Volume of Oxygen Maximum)

Determined using:

Maximum heart rate achieved during a timed activity

Resting heart rate
Athletes in this program have:

A maximum heart rate of 200 BPM

A minimum resting heart rate of 45 BPM, lower than average due to elite conditioning

🏅 Player Positions

There are 5 basketball positions, each with 2 athletes:

Point Guards

Shooting Guards

Small Forwards

Power Forwards

Centres

Each athlete records BMI and VO2 max data throughout training. These metrics are used to assess their fitness levels and compare them to international standards.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This tool processes BMI and VO2 max values for all athletes and provides a structured way to evaluate their fitness progression during training camp.
